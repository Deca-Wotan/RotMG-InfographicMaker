# RotMG-InfographicMaker
RotMG Infographic Maker generates infographics from item text given in Realm of the Mad God blogposts.

# Requirements
All files in the .zip must be in the same folder as application except Infographics (it is there for easy storage of generated infographics).

An internet connection is required.

# Priority Sorting and Dictionary Modifying
Dictionary files must start with a number followed by an exclamation mark (!). The number determines the priority of the items in the dictionary file. The first items rendered by the infographic maker come from the file that starts with 1!, then 2!, then 3!, and so on. New dictionary files can be added and others can be removed, I try to keep the files in the .zip updated to contain all the items from the game.

To add or modify a dictionary entry, make sure you follow the format:

"Item Name" src="//link"

The link must not have any "https:" or "http:". The infographic maker is case-sensitive so it is recommended that you capitalize the item name as a title.
